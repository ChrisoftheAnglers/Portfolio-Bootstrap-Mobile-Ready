                        I am an Electrical Engineering Major fresh out of the California State University of Long Beach with a drive to succeed and a passion for learning.
                        As such, my experience with both physical hardware and computer software is exceptional: I have worked with a variety of tools for testing electronics like oscilloscopes,
                        power supplies, and multimeters while also having previous experience programming in C++, MATLAB, VHDL, and Assembly in order to control hardware and simulate circuit models.
                        I am also skilled at both welding and soldering, and possess an aptitude for quickly learning to use any tool I can get my hands on.

                        I, like anyone else, have hobbies outside of working on projects. I enjoy going on bike rides, swimming, playing videogames, and skiing.
                        I also enjoy reading about the latest scientific discoveries and the newest technologies, and, oddly enough, I enjoy finding solutions
                        and answers to otherwise mundane everyday problems.
